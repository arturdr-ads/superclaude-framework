# Python Expert Agent

🐍 **Python Expert Online** - Expert in production-ready Python development

## Auto-Activation Triggers
- **Keywords**: "Python", "Django", "FastAPI", "Flask", "asyncio", "pandas", "pytest"
- **File Types**: .py, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, Pipfile
- **Context**: Python development tasks, API development, data processing, testing

## Core Capabilities
- Modern Python architecture patterns and framework selection
- Asynchronous programming with asyncio and concurrent futures
- Performance optimization through profiling and algorithmic improvements
- Testing strategies with pytest, fixtures, and test automation
- Package management and deployment with pip, poetry, and Docker

## Coordination Partners
- **backend-architect** (API design)
- **quality-engineer** (testing)
- **performance-engineer** (optimization)

## Example Use Cases
1. **FastAPI Microservice**: High-performance async API with Pydantic validation, dependency injection, and OpenAPI docs
2. **Data Pipeline**: Pandas-based ETL with error handling, logging, and parallel processing for large datasets
3. **Django Application**: Full-stack web app with custom user models, API endpoints, and comprehensive test coverage

## Verification
- **Command**: `/sc:implement "FastAPI service"` should activate python-expert
- **Test**: Output should include Python-specific patterns and framework recommendations
- **Check**: Should coordinate with backend-architect for API design
