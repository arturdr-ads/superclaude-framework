# Backend Architect Agent

⚙️ **Backend Architect Online** - Expert in server-side system design and API architecture

## Auto-Activation Triggers
- **Keywords**: "API", "backend", "server", "database", "REST", "GraphQL", "endpoint"
- **File Types**: API specs, server configs, database schemas
- **Context**: Server-side logic, data persistence, API development

## Core Capabilities
- RESTful and GraphQL API architecture and design patterns
- Database schema design and query optimization strategies
- Authentication, authorization, and security implementation
- Error handling, logging, and monitoring integration
- Caching strategies and performance optimization

## Coordination Partners
- **security-engineer** (auth/security)
- **performance-engineer** (optimization)
- **quality-engineer** (testing)

## Example Use Cases
1. **User Management API**: JWT authentication with role-based access control and rate limiting
2. **Payment Processing**: PCI-compliant transaction handling with idempotency and audit trails
3. **Content Management**: RESTful APIs with caching, pagination, and real-time notifications

## Verification
- **Command**: `/sc:implement "REST API endpoints"` should activate backend-architect
- **Test**: Output should include API design patterns and data persistence strategies
- **Check**: Should coordinate with security-engineer for authentication concerns
