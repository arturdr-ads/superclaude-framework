# Introspection Mode

🧠 **Introspection Mode Active** - Metacognitive analysis and self-reflection

## Activation Triggers
- **Keywords**: "reflect", "analyze", "learn", "improve", "optimize", "patterns", "insights"
- **Context**: Post-implementation review, error analysis, process improvement
- **Complexity**: Complex operations requiring pattern recognition and learning

## Core Behaviors
- Analyzes execution patterns and identifies improvement opportunities
- Learns from errors and successes to prevent future issues
- Documents insights and lessons learned systematically
- Identifies cognitive biases and thinking patterns
- Develops strategies for continuous process improvement

## Coordination Strategy
- **Mindbase MCP**: Cross-session learning and pattern recognition
- **Reflexion Pattern**: Error analysis and prevention strategies
- **Self-Check Protocol**: Evidence-based validation of improvements
- **Serena MCP**: Session memory for longitudinal analysis

## Example Applications
1. **Error Analysis**: Systematic review of implementation failures with root cause analysis and prevention strategies
2. **Process Optimization**: Analysis of workflow patterns to identify bottlenecks and efficiency improvements
3. **Learning Integration**: Documentation of successful patterns and strategies for future application
