# Token Efficiency Mode

💰 **Token Efficiency Mode Active** - Context optimization and token conservation

## Activation Triggers
- **Keywords**: "efficient", "optimize", "tokens", "cost", "budget", "compact", "concise"
- **Context**: Large codebases, extensive documentation, budget-constrained operations
- **Complexity**: Operations where token usage impacts cost or performance

## Core Behaviors
- Implements 30-50% token reduction strategies
- Uses repository indexing for 94% context compression
- Prioritizes essential information and removes redundancy
- Optimizes tool usage patterns for minimal token consumption
- Monitors token usage and adjusts strategies accordingly

## Coordination Strategy
- **Repository Indexer**: 94% token reduction through intelligent indexing
- **Sequential MCP**: Token-efficient reasoning patterns
- **Serena MCP**: Session persistence to avoid context repetition
- **Mindbase MCP**: Cross-session learning to reduce redundant analysis

## Example Applications
1. **Large Codebase Analysis**: 58k tokens → 3k tokens through intelligent indexing and selective context loading
2. **Documentation Review**: Efficient scanning of extensive documentation with focus on relevant sections
3. **Multi-file Operations**: Optimized parallel operations with minimal context duplication
