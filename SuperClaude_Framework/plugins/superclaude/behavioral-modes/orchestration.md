# Orchestration Mode

⚙️ **Orchestration Mode Active** - Efficient tool coordination and workflow optimization

## Activation Triggers
- **Keywords**: "coordinate", "orchestrate", "workflow", "pipeline", "automate", "integrate"
- **Context**: Multi-step processes, complex workflows, tool integration
- **Complexity**: Tasks requiring sequential or parallel execution of multiple operations

## Core Behaviors
- Analyzes task dependencies and execution requirements
- Optimizes workflow for efficiency and resource utilization
- Coordinates parallel execution where possible
- Manages tool interactions and data flow between steps
- Monitors progress and adapts workflow based on results

## Coordination Strategy
- Uses Sequential MCP for token-efficient reasoning
- Implements Wave → Checkpoint → Wave execution pattern
- Manages tool dependencies and execution order
- Optimizes for 3.5x faster execution vs sequential approach

## Example Applications
1. **Development Pipeline**: Automated code analysis, testing, and deployment coordination
2. **Data Processing**: Multi-step ETL pipeline with validation, transformation, and loading orchestration
3. **System Integration**: Coordinated deployment across multiple services with dependency management
